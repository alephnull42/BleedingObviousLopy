# BleedingObviousLopy
This text explains the existence of several pieces of very primitive code on GitHub
Being able to show my children "I type this thing here, that led over there goes on, but you have to have that resistor there because otherwise the thing fries"

## Why 
I supported the #LoPy kickstarter by accident because :
- my friend @lispmeister did
- it said "Python"
- it said "IoT"
- it said "Telnet"
- it implied a Command Line
- it could make pins go high
- I had a raspberry Pi

## Command Line
My 1st computer ZX81 in 1982-ish, 10 years old, 1KB (7 tweets) of memory 
My 2nd computer SHarp MZ80K in 1984, 11.5 years old, you had to load BASIC from audio tape ~4 minutes
My 3rd computer an Apple 2 
My 4th computer an IBM PC clone my dad baouth from taiwan
Every generation since then
I grew up before compputers had a  mouse
